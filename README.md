This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: the misuse of `On Error Resume Next`. The `bug.vbs` file contains a function that uses `GetSetting` without proper error checking, potentially leading to silent failures and making debugging a nightmare.  The `bugSolution.vbs` file shows a more robust way to handle potential errors.  Always ensure you have explicit and informative error handling in your VBScript code to prevent unexpected behavior and make debugging easier.
